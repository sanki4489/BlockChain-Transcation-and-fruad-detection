# BlockChain-Transcation-and-fruad-detection

Implemented using Java
 Four blocks are created and simple transcation were made to accounts.
 Hashes are created based on every transcations happening in the blocks.
 Each transcations hashes are recorded.
 
 Now if a fraud were to happen the hash value of every transcation will change and we can detect the fraud.
